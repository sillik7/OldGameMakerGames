		<h1>Old Game Maker Games Archive</h1>
		<p class="intro">
			This is an attempt to archive all <a href="https://gamemaker.io/en">Game Maker</a> games from the old official site's Games Showcase page.<br/>
			Game Maker is not required to run any of the games, I made sure they're all easily playable out of the box.<br/>
			All the games that come as an installer have been extracted, with the installer still included in the package.<br/>
			Games made in Game Maker 6 and 6.1 have been patched to run on modern computers. Still, I can only confirm that all the games run fine on Windows 8, I haven't tested them on other machines.<br/>
			Games marked as "Editable" still contain an executable, but also provide the source file (gmf, gmd or gm6).<br/>
			If you can provide any of the missing games (the ones with red background), or want a game removed, please contact me at <img src="mail.png" />.<br/>
			Special thanks to:
